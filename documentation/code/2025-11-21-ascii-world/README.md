# ASCII World

A tool to generate ASCII SVGs from an image, with the characters "hello, world".

## Description

- Talk about the extractivist (and not generative) logic of AI.
- Talk about how we transform the world to make it readable by machines.
- It uses the first words a human typically exchanges when creating a robot (Hello, World!) as an ASCII characters to represent the world.
- It represents the end or completion of a cycle, in this case, the cycle of the digitalization of the world.
- The two slashes add put "synthetic" as comment, and evoke the two wands held by the woman on the original card.
- The grid represents the standardization of the world, of ways of thinking, of know-how, of knowledge...

## Print

- Will be printed with an axidraw robot.
