This folder contains all the tangible results and outputs generated from my course, work and observations.

## Print the cards

The SVG file is made to be printed with an Axidraw plotter. To do that, you should use Inkscape with the Axidraw extension installed.

### Use the Cam Bam font

Axidraw can plot stroke text with `Text Hershey`extension. You can use custom fonts. To do that, you need to provide the `absolute path` to the font. The font sould be a SVG font.

```text
    /path/to/font/cam-bam-stick-4.svg
```
